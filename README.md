# Problem Statement
Factories have difficulties managing their inventory stock and materials, which leads to incomplete order fulfilment and this, in turn, leads to increased production costs and overall loss.

# Overview
A centralised inventory management system that enables managers and employees to track their product inventory, including the products they sell, their stocks and price changes. It also includes a relation to the raw materials the factory procures to manufacture their products. Manage the suppliers and raw materials separately and also set up a separate relationship for buyers and the orders and stocks.
